You can write plugin yourself, most function interface are based on asynchrnous method. We use <code>async.js</code> to write asynchronous code and logic. Our plug-in could be a layout, form or page fragment. You just need to drag in toolbar and drop it to editing area, then you can see beautiful design. Run it in dynamical page or a new separate page if you want.</p>
<p>The complex in this project is asynchronous flow control, contains HTML, CSS and JavaScript and do not conflict with each other.</p>
