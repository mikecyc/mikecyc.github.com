Although we could pick many open-source framework, but we write it myself, because we need lots of custom plugin. All modules, database and UI are designed myself.</p>
<p>Although it is not a perfect project, but we enjoyed it. You can find some front end code on <a href="https://github.com/mikecyc/myPlugins">Github</a>.</p>
