Although there are many open-source framework, but we would write lots of custom plugin, so we develop their own. All modules, database and UI are designed myself.</p>
<p>Although it is not perfect project, and very hard, but we enjoyed it. You can find some front end code on <a href="https://github.com/mikecyc/myPlugins">Github</a>.</p>
