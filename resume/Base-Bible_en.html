I love read Bible every day, in the beginning just wanted to design a tool that can search the Scriptures. After the first version, I think it was good, then registered the domain and bought VPS to build up this site. Where I learn a lot of Security technology on Linux, including how to optimize system. I wrote Shell script to manager hosts.</p>
